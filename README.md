A simple Blackjack cards game using html, css and javascript
## Description:
This Blackjack game is developed using basic html, css and javascript which indeed is a fun and flexible application to be used.
## Features and How it works?
Whenever the player clicks onto the 'start new game' button, two random  cards numbered between 1 to 11 are drawn by the player. If the sum of these two cards is equal to 21 the player is considered to have a blackjack and his/her chips are increased by a total of 10 dollars, and the player is not allowed to grab a new card.
In the other case if sum of cards drawn by the player is lesser than 21 player is still allowed to grab the new cards until he/she wins or losses the game.
If sum of cards drawn by the player exceeds 21 than the player is considered to have lost the game and player's total chips are decreased by a total of 5 dollars.
